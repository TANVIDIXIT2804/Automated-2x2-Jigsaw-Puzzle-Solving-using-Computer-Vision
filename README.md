Computer vision can be used to automatically solve jigsaw puzzles by detecting, 
extracting, and analyzing the puzzle pieces' shape, color, texture, and unique 
features. Afterward, the pieces can be assembled using algorithms such as graph-based 
matching, template matching, or deep learning-based methods. This requires a combination
of image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning algorithms. Automating jigsaw puzzle-solving has many potential applications, including robotics, gaming, and image and video processing.

Permutation Invariance:
A function is a permutation invariant if its output does not change by changing the ordering of its input. 
A jigsaw puzzle is also permutation invariance. No matter what the ordering of puzzle pieces are the output would always be fixed.
